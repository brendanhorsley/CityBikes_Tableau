# Citibike Analysis

The purpose of this project was to analyze data regarding the usage of bikes through Citibike. 
Different visualizations were created through the use of Tableau Public, a free software used to map and graph data.
Investors are eager to see the results of this analysis to aid them in determining whether Citibike is a worthwhile investment.
The main data the investors are interested in is the usage of bikes, i.e. how long trips are, when trips occur and who is making these trips.

## Results

All graphs can be found at the following Tableau Public link: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/brendan.horsley

The first visualization produced analyzes the average trip duration, we can see that Citibike users tend to have trips under 20 minutes long.

From these visualization we can see that trip duration is commonly around 10 minutes long. Additionally, males tend to use the service more often than females.
To understand the time people used bikes heatmaps were created where the darker regions represent higher usage.

From this heatmap we can see that bikes are most commonly used around 7:00-8:00am and 4:00-6:00pm on weekdays, and at moderate levels throughout the entire days on weekends.

Once again comparing the difference between males and females we can see the higher use of bikes by males.
One slight difference between genders is that females use on Saturdays is slightly higher in comparison to males relative to the overall usage rates.
Males have much darker heatmaps on weekdays before and after regular work hours than they do for weekends.
Finally, a heatmap was created to examine the usage of subscribers versus unsubscribed customers.

![Subscribers](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96553988/162648380-9153042a-0eb3-49c4-9a67-2b9f673a4225.png)

This heatmap shows that the total usage by subscribers is much higher than that of non-subscribed customers.

## Summary

Based on the analysis, it appears males are more common users than females for Citibike. This could mean 3 things. Firstly, it could be that males generally are more willing to use bike-sharing services than females, to investigate this data should be compared to similar bike-sharing services through other companies. If the first explanation is not true than it means 1 of 2 things, either this service does a better job at marketing and appealing to males than females, or it poorly accomodates and markets to females. If it is the final explanation this could mean the potential value of this service has not been reached yet and through better marketing and accomodation to females the service would yield higher usage rates. Similar data is seen between customers and subscribers. The service has much higher usage rates for subscribers. It is difficult to tell from this analysis alone.
